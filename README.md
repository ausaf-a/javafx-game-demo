# JavaFX Sprite Engine

## Motivation
I was building a game using JavaFX for a class, but an issue we ran into was there not being an easy to use animation framework for JavaFX. I didn't see what stopped this from being possible, so I implemented this myself using the JavaFX Scene Graph SDK. All drawing is done using JavaFX nodes without obtaining the underlying graphics context.
